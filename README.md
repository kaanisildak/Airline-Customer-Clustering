# Airline-Customer-Clustering
East-West Airlines is trying to learn more about its customers.  Key issues are their flying patterns, earning and use of frequent flyer rewards, and use of the airline credit card. The task is to identify customer segments via clustering. For each passenger the data include information on their mileage history and on different ways they accrued or spent miles in the last year. The goal is to try to identify clusters of passengers that have similar charactersitics for the purpose of targeting different segments for different types of mileage offers.
